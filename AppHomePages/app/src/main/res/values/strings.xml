    <!-- Description Strings -->
    <string name="LinearSearchDescription">Linear search is an O(n) algorithm that looks through all the elements in an unsorted array for a specific value. This is like looking for a specific assignment in a stack of unsorted school papers that accumulated at the bottom of your backpack. You have to look through all the papers to see if the specific paper is in the stack. </string>

    <string name="BinarySearchDescription">Binary search is an O(log n) algorithm that looks through all the elements in a pre-sorted array for a specific value. The runtime comes from the fact that, due to the fact the array is ordered, half of the array can be discarded at each step. This is because we can determine in which half the value should be found, if it is in the array. </string>

    <string name="BubbleSortDescription">Bubble sort is a O(n^2) algorithm where values are swapped in pairs and, at each step, the largest values \"bubble\" to the rightmost side of the array. The array ends up sorted at the end. </string>

    <string name="InsertionSortDescription">Insertion sort is a O(n^2) algorithm where the first element is counted as sorted. Then, each element in the array is selected and inserted into the correct location in the sorted array. This algorithm is like how you organize a hand of cards, since you start with one card, and then, as you select additional cards, you insert them into the correct location in the hand one-by-one. At the end, you have a sorted array or, in our example, hand of cards. </string>

    <string name="SelectionSortDescription">Selection sort is a O(n^2) algorithm where the next smallest element from an unsorted portion of an array is selected and inserted into the sorted portion of the array. This is like how you would sort a group of coins if you had a pile in front of you. You would first look through all the coins, pick out a penny, and then place it in a sorted position. Next, you would look through and select all pennies this way. Next, you would repeat this process for nickles, dimes, and finally quarters. </string>

    <string name="MergeSortDescription">Merge sort is a O(n (log n)) algorithm where the array is broken into pieces recursively with a base case of 1 element, which is automatically sorted. These halves are merged together repeatedly until a sorted array is built. </string>

    <string name="QuickSortDescription">Quicksort is a O(n (log n)) algorithm where a pivot is selected and sections are recursively sorted by having all elements smaller and larger than the pivot organized on the proper side of the pivot. </string>

    <string name="DepthFirstSearchDescription">Depth first search is an O(|V| + |E|) algorithm where |V| is the number of vertices in the graph and |E| is the number of edges. This algorithm uses a Stack to explore farthest down a path in a graph before backtracking. If no element is being sought, the depth-first search becomes a depth-first traversal of the graph. </string>

    <string name="BreadthFirstSearchDescription">Breadth first search is an O(|V| + |E|) algorithm where |V| is the number of vertices in the graph and |E| is the number of edges. This algorithm uses a Queue to explore the layers of a graph. If no element is being sought, the breadth-first search becomes a breadth-first traversal of the graph where each layer of the graph is traversed. </string>

    <string name="TopologicalOrderingDescription">Topological ordering is commonly an O(|V| + |E|) algorithm where |V| is the number of vertices in the graph and |E| is the number of edges. Topological ordering is useful whenever there are dependencies between data that needs to be ordered. For example, course scheduling, cooking recipes, and getting dressed are all scenarios where some steps must come before others, and different pieces of the data are interconnected. </string>

    <string name="DijkstrasDescription">The displayed version of Dijkstra\'s algorithm is an O(|V|^2) algorithm. In Dijkstra\'s, the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in the graph is computed. The edges must all have non-negative edge weights. Dijkstra\'s could be used to model shortest travel time between friend\'s houses with your house as a starting point. </string>

    <string name="MinEditDescription">Min Edit Distance algorithm is an O(m * n) algorithm where m and n are the lengths of the strings being compared. This algorithm computes the minimum edit - insertions, deletion, or substitution - cost of changing one string into another string. In our example, we use 1 as the cost of insertion or deletion and 2 as the cost of substitution. If the character being substituted is the same, then we use 0 as the substitution value. </string>
